In simple terms, a credit card is an instrument which allows you to purchase stuff on credit. It's a lot more than that and we'll talk about it further. 

## The Misunderstood Fear of Interest?
Alot of people think that we have to pay high interests on the credit we use but this is not actually how it works. Almost all credit cards have a window untill which if we pay the bill, we are not charged with interest.

FIVE% is a lot considering the interest rates nowadays on savings accounts. Not just this, it gives 4% cashback on Swiggy, Ola, and Zomato, 2% cashback on all other spends with no upper limit. That is insane considering the amount we can save with day to day purchases. It also provides lounge access and other features such as restaurant partner offers up to 20% off and fuel surcharge waivers.

Similarly, there are hunderds of cards with wide range of offers such as Flipkart Axis Card gives unlimited 5% cashback on Fplikart, Myntra and 4% flat cashback on Uber, Swiggy, MakeMyTrip, PVR, GoIbibo, etc and other partner sites. The ICICI Amazon Pay card gives upto 5% cashback on Amazon and cashbacks on many other partner sites.The list of such cards goes on forever and maybe I'll make a blog about the top best caredit cards you can have.
