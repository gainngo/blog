Founded by Swati & Rohan Bhargava in April 2013, CashKaro.com is India's Largest Cashback & Coupons site. Backed by Mr. Ratan Tata & one of India's leading VC firms, Kalaari Capital. With over 5 million registered users, CashKaro is a one stop destination for savings across 1500+ ecommerce sites like Amazon.in, Flipkart, Myntra etc.

It works for most of the popular shopping websites.

## How to get cashback?

Just [click here](https://cashk.app.link/XQPsy7f3leb) and register on the app and website and start getting rewards. You can also invite your friends and get a part of their earnings as well. Don't forget to register from above affiliate link. I have earned more than 4k untill now.

## How it works?
Cashkaro is an affiliate service which rewards you when you shop through their platform. This rewards can be a percentage range of your cart value or can be exclusive offers such as many times the webiste have exclusive offers with brands and offer attracive deals on alot of stuff.
Just click on your choice of store and you'll be redirected to the platform where you can add items in your cart.
Remember, don't forget to add products in cart only when you have opened the site through Cashkaro.
The cashback/rewards earned will be tracked within 3 days and if it dosen't you can raise a ticket and the Cashkaro team will look into it.

## Difference between Cashback and Rewads
The cashback received can be withdrawn in your account but the rewards earned can be redeemed through gift cards only. This is not a hurdle as gift cards are nowadays as useful as cash. Also, we can also combine cashback and rewards and redeem them together in form of gift card.
