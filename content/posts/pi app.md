As Pi Network have not yet started transactional operations, it's giving free Pi coins for just keeping the app on your pjone. You just have to opne the app once in every 24 hours and click "Mine" to start mining. Your mining rates depend on your referrals and your sercurity circles, etc. The developers have said that soon the mining rates will be cut down as more people join to make it scarce and hence, more valuable.
The mining does not drain your phone's battery as it dosen't use phone resources to mining like how typically cryptocurrency is mined.

### Steps to start mining free Pi:
Go to https://minepi.com/shailendrasr and use "shailendrasr" as invite code to join the app and start mining. 
You can also download the official Pi Network application from Play Store or App Store.

## Update
Pi have started rolling out KYC process that means that we can soon expect transactional capabilities which will allow us to buy and sell the currency.
